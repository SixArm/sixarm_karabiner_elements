# SixArm Karabiner-Elements

[Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) is a macOS application that enables keyboard changes such as remappings of the caps lock key, control key, escape key, and much more.

We especially like these remappings that we use with `vi`, `emacs`, `tmux`, and similar kinds of command-line applications:

* [Change from caps_lock to control (if held) or escape (if released)](change_from_caps_lock_to_control_or_escape.json)

* [Change from right_command to control-b tmux prefix](change_from_right_command_to_control_b_tmux_prefix.json)



## Install

To install, copy the file you want to your Karabiner-Elements assets directory, such as:

```
~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/
```

Enable:

* Launch Karabiner-Elements as usual. 

* Tap the icon in your macOS menu bar. 

* Choose the menu item "Preferences...".

* Choose the tab "Complex modifications".

* Click the button "Add Rule".

* Scroll to find the rule, then click the button "Enable".


## Customization

You can customize these files as you wish.

You can also create your own files, the same kind of way.
